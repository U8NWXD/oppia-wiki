Oppia is excited to be participating in [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/)'s December 2021 to March 2022 round! Outreachy is a diversity initiative that provides paid, remote internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by under-representation in the technical industry where they are living.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Here you can find initial guidance on how to get started with the required tasks listed on the project [Scale Community Outreach and Conduct Research on Oppia's Lessons](https://www.outreachy.org/outreachy-december-2021-internship-round/communities/oppia/#scale-community-outreach-and-conduct-research-on-o).

If you have any questions, feel free to send them to outreachy-questions@oppia.org or send them **directly to mentors by email**.

## Getting Started

Please follow these steps to get started:

### User Studies

*  For the user studies, start reading [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1S9HnoesGZMNeYccV8rXZ2bZwPhKV5-B6j9CnPRM_I/edit?usp=sharing)  that provides information on how to properly perform a user study or learner feedback session on Oppia's math lessons. You can also use [this checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ybGCKSsa8fIqcBliavShN06f_PakiiBPPxLg6d48R2w/edit?usp=sharing) to help make sure you don't miss any important steps. 
* We recommend that you conduct learner feedback sessions on at least 3 consecutive chapters (either Web/Android Platform) on any of the math topics inside [Oppia Classroom](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1S9HnoesGZMNeYccV8rXZ2bZwPhKV5-B6j9CnPRM_I/edit?usp=sharing). One student is enough for the contributing period, but you can work with more if you want to.
*  Remember that for the sessions, you will have to make sure that the chapters you will use and the materials (surveys and tests) listed in the guide/checklist are translated in the student's language. Also remember that the report on your findings is your main deliverable for this task, and we recommend you follow the report template listed on the guide/checklist to save effort and avoid missing relevant information. 

### Reaching and defining pilots plan with NGOs

* For reaching and drafting pilot plans with NGOs, we recommend that you start finding and listing a few NGOs related to children's education that you could potentially work with to use Oppia lessons. You will need to contact and meet with the NGOs in order to introduce Oppia and talk about the NGO activities. 
* In this meeting, try to understand their pains and needs to better find a way for us to work together in a mutually beneficial partnership. You may make a copy and personalize these [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kWXni2omdpOZjUId712odYGSxfEziHg0wu81ChdvHAE/edit?usp=sharing) to help you pitch Oppia to the partner.
* After you have a good understanding of the NGO context, work with them to draft a pilot plan detailing how they can include Oppia in their activities. If you think you need help on how to prioritize which NGOs to reach and how elaborate a nice reach out message, you can email our mentors for more materials.

### Reaching and defining pilots plan with NGOs
* For this task, you will need to create a plan on how you would scale the lessons and provide them to a larger audience in your country. It's important for the plan to be supported by reliable research that can include: 
   1. a benchmark analysis of similar products in your region
   2. an analysis of your country's/region's demographics, and 
   3. an analysis of existing NGOs and potential partners. 
* You can use any documents and research you find relevant to support your proposal. The format of the plan is completely up to you. 
* If you need help with the background research for your plan, you can contact the mentors for further guidance and additional materials.
