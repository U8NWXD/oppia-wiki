## Introduction

When collecting user input, we often define the kind of input we expect using [[schemas|Schemas]]. These schemas can describe arbitrarily nested collections of base types. We call these base types _objects_. For example, consider this schema:

```json
{
  "type": "dict",
  "properties": [
    {
      "name": "version",
      "schema": {
        "type": "int"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The schema would match a dictionary like this:

```json
{"version": 34}
```

This schema describes a dictionary with a `version` key whose value is an `int`, and the `int` type is an object. We define these objects as classes in [`extensions/objects/models/objects.py`](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/blob/develop/extensions/objects/models/objects.py) and components in [`extensions.objects/templates`](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/blob/develop/extensions/objects/templates).

## How objects are defined

### Python classes

The Python classes for objects are defined in `objects.py`. For example, here's the class for the `int` type:

```python
class Int(BaseObject):
    """Integer class."""

    description = 'An integer.'
    default_value = 0

    @classmethod
    def get_schema(cls):
        """Returns the object schema.

        Returns:
            dict. The object schema.
        """
        return {
            'type': 'int'
        }
```

Object classes all meet the following criteria:

* They inherit from either `BaseObject` or another object class.
* Their `description` class variables are set to a string describing the object.
* Their `default_value` class variables are set to the value that should be the default whenever this type is used in a rule. Note that this variable is technically not required if the object will never be used in a [[rule|Creating-rules]].
* They provide a `normalize()` class method that accepts a raw Python object. The method should first validate the raw object to check whether it is malformed. If the validation checks pass, then the method should return a normalized form of the object. Note that in this context, "normalized" means a primitive Python type or multiple primitive types combined with lists and/or dicts.

  * The `BaseObject` class provides a `normalize` class method that can normalize any object so long as the object's class provides a `get_schema` class method that returns a schema describing the object. `BaseObject.normalize` passes the schema to `schema_utils.normalize_against_schema`, so make sure that `normalize_against_schema` won't try to normalize the object using the object class. Otherwise, there will be an endless loop between `normalize_against_schema` and `BaseObject.normalize`.

### Angular components

Every object is accompanied by a component defined in `extensions/objects/templates` and imported in `extensions/objects/object-components.module.ts`. Each component provides the HTML and frontend code needed to create a form for the user to provide input in the form of the object. These components rely heavily on [schema-based forms](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Schemas#schema-based-forms). For example, the `int-editor` component's HTML is just this:

```html
<schema-based-editor [schema]="getSchema.bind(this)"
                     [localValue]="value"
                     (localValueChange)="updateValue($event)">
</schema-based-editor>
```

The `getSchema` function is defined in `int-editor.component.ts` and returns this schema:

```json
{
  type: "int",
  validators: [{
    id: "is_integer"
  }]
}
```

The `schema-based-editor` component already knows how to construct a form for this schema.

## Create a new object

Let's suppose you're creating a new object called `MyObject` (in practice you should use a more descriptive name). You'll need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new object class named `MyObject`. It must satisfy the [criteria documented above](#python-classes).
2. Add tests for your class in `extensions/objects/models/objects_test.py`. You should add normalization tests to the `ObjectNormalizationUnitTests` class. You can also create a new test class to hold additional test cases.
3. Add a new [Angular component](#angular-components) to accept input in the form of your object. Your component files should be named `my-object-editor.component.*`, and your component class should be named `MyObjectEditorComponent`.
4. Import your component in `extensions/objects/object-components.module.ts` and add it to the module there.

## Using objects

You will usually use objects by referencing them as you [[create interactions|Creating-Interactions]], [[define rules|Creating-Rules]], or otherwise use [[schemas|Schemas]].
